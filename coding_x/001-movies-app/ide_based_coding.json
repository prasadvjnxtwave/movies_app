This project allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned till React Course and apply them in a concrete project.\n\nYou will demonstrate your skills by creating an app that will fetch data from an internal server using a class component, displaying that data, using **component lifecycle** methods, **routing** concepts, **authentication**, and **authorization**, and adding responsiveness to the website.\n\nThis is an individual assessment. All work must be your own.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n#### UI Prerequisites\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to view</summary>\n\n- What is Figma?\n  - Figma is a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool which is primarily web-based.

React Slick\n\n    - React Slick <a href=\"https://react-slick.neostack.com/docs/get-started\" target=\"_blank\">Documentation</a>\n    - React Slick implementation <a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/react-slick-demo-iz90x?file=/src/components/ReactSlick/index.js\" target=\"_blank\">CodeSandbox</a>\n    - Update the CSS accordingly to style the React Slider and arrow buttons, you can check the <a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/react-slick-demo-iz90x?file=/src/components/ReactSlick/index.css\" target=\"_blank\">CodeSandbox</a>\n    - Add the below CDN links in your `public > index.html` file for CSS and Font, you can check the <a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/react-slick-demo-iz90x?file=/public/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">CodeSandbox</a> for adding below lines\n\n    ```jsx\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" charset=\"UTF-8\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/slick-carousel/1.6.0/slick.min.css\" />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/slick-carousel/1.6.0/slick-theme.min.css\" />\n    ```\n\n  -

Instead of rendering the same elements twice for responsiveness.\n  - For Mini Projects, You have to use normal HTML elements to style the React Components. Usage of `styled-components` (CSS in JS) to style React components are not supported in Mini Projects. Test cases won't be passed, If you use styled components.\n  - Refer to the below Example for the usage of `data-testid` in the HTML elements.\n\n    - Example: `<div data-testid=\"movieItem\" className=\"movie-item\"/>`.\n\n- **Routes**\n\n  - Render `Login` Route component when the path in URL matches `/login`\n  - Render `Home` Route component when the path in URL matches `/`\n  - Render `Popular` Route component when the path in URL matches `/popular`\n  - Render `Movie Item Details` Route component when the path in URL matches `/movies/:id`\n  - Render `Search` Route component when the path in URL matches `/search`\n  - Render `Account` Route component when the path in URL matches `/account`\n\n- Wrap the `Loader` component with an HTML container element and add the `data-testid` attribute value as **loader** to it\n\n  ```jsx\n  <div className=\"loader-container\" data-testid=\"loader\">\n    <Loader type=\"TailSpin\" color=\"#D81F26\" height={50} width={50} />\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n- **Login Route**\n\n  - The Movies App Logo image should consist of alt attribute value as `login website logo`\n  - The Cookies should be set by using the key name `jwt_token`\n\n- **Home Route**\n\n  - The movie images in the Home Route should have the alt attribute as the value of the key `title` from each object in Trending Now Movies Response, Originals Response\n\n- **Movie Item Details Route**\n\n  - The movie images in the Movie Item Details Route should have the alt as the value of the key `title` from each object in similarMoviesResponse\n  - The `runtime` key value received from the movie Item Details response, should be converted from minutes to hours and minutes and displayed in Movie Item Details Route\n  - The censor rating of the movie in the Movie Item Details Route should be displayed as **A** if the `adult` key value received from the movie Item Details response is true.

These are not required. If you do not reach the stretch goals, don't worry.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Additional Functionality to be added</summary>\n\n- Home Route\n  - An HTTP Get request should be made to **Top Rated Movies API URL** as well\n    - **_Loader_** should be displayed while fetching the data\n    - After the data is successfully fetched from the API\n      - Display the list of movies received from the top rated movies response\n    - If the HTTP GET request made is unsuccessful, then the failure view given in the **Figma** screens should be displayed\n      - When the **Try Again** button is clicked, then the HTTP GET request should be made to **Top Rated Movies API URL**\n- Users can browse popular movies & searched movies using pagination buttons.\n</details>\n\n### Project Submission Instructions\n\n- For Mini Projects, you can submit the test cases at your own pace. But we suggest you to submit the code to know the percentage of completion through test cases and that score will be considered for your interviews.\n\n- Also it's important to publish your code frequently using `Step - 4` in the Instructions tab.\n\n> ### _Things to Keep in Mind_\n>\n> - All components you implement should go in the `src/components` directory.\n> - **Do not remove the pre-filled code**\n> - Want to quickly review some of the concepts you’ve been learning? Take a look at the Cheat Sheets.\n",
